      <p>Crisfield Academy and High School (commonly abbreviated to CAHS), also once known as simply Crisfield High School (CHS), is a public high school in the city of Crisfield in Somerset County, Maryland, United States. It is located in the Somerset County Public Schools district and handles five grades: 8th and 9th grade are handled in an "academy" section of the school, while grades 10 through 12 are handled as high school. The school is on North Somerset Avenue, between the intersections of Potomac Street and Mercury Lane, and is close to Maryland Route 413. It has the distinction of being the southernmost high school in the state of Maryland.</p>

      <p>Prior to 1908, there was only one educational facility in Crisfield: the original Crisfield Academy, located on Asbury Avenue near the intersection with Somerset Avenue. In 1908, the very first Crisfield High School was built, succeeding the Academy. This school, however, only served the white population of Crisfield. This building was closed in 1926 when a new, larger building was constructed, on Somerset Avenue. A school had also been built shortly before World War II for the African-American population, named Crisfield Colored High School, which succeeded limited facilities for those students whom beforehand were only equipped for teaching up to sixth grade. This building was located on Collins Street, near the current site of Family Dollar.[2] Eventually, this building would be succeeded by Woodson High School, on South Somerset Avenue.</p>

      <p>Crisfield's graduation rate has been steadily declining over the past 12 years. In 2007, the school graduated 63.5% of its seniors, down from a high of 86.7% in 2002.</p>
      <p>Crisfield is a fairly small high school. In 2007, the school showed its largest enrollment over the previous 12 years.</p>

        Crisfield Academy and High School hosts several different sports, most noticeably basketball (known as the Crisfield Crabbers), which wins the school most of its sports championships.[4] The school also has a soccer,[5] lacrosse, and field hockey team.

        CHS also has a high school band, which is affectionately known as the "Pride of Somerset" as it was once the largest organization of any sort in the county; however, this is no longer the case, as even the Washington High School band is larger at present. The school also has an AJROTC, implemented during the 2003-2004 school year.
